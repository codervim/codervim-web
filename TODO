I do not think that this document could offer all the information you need to learn a tool. And that is exactly what I
don't want. I will just offer a direction, a way that many predecessors have walked.

I also don't think that people would like to finish reading all the articles here, although there are not many, no more 
than 50. It is not interesting for some people. But, to the one who really want to be a real programmer, I suggest you read
them one by one. 
  
  
  
To programers who do not use VIM
Get fraustrated? No worry, maybe it is not the right time for you. 
If you are  really interested in programming, I promise that you will come back soon.
