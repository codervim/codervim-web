  The configuration script of VIM is actually a programming language. What is the difference between this configuation 
script and the one of nginx? What is the difference between a config script and a language? Maybe you are just told 
that it is a language. So, what is a language? 
  Obviously, VIM config script has variables, functions. It can express much more meaning than normal key-value 
config files.
