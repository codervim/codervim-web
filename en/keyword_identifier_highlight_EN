  Many programmer would notice that VIM could has the ability to highlight the keywords and identifiers when editing 
a script of some common programming language. It is beautiful and could help us to have a better view of the code text. Of
course, keywords and identifiers highlight are the basic function of IDE. So my question is does these two kinds of tools
use the same way to accomplish the highlighting function? Can you do it by yourself?
