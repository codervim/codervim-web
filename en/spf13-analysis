   Spf

  Spf declares that it is the best vim config. I am afraid that is true for most
people. It is truly powerful and beautiful. I suggest everybody should try it.
This post is going to give a simple and comprehensive analysis of this config. 

dependants on:
  Vundle  https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim
  
spf13-vim bundle configuration : ?

  .vimrc.local > .vimrc 


There are many config files. It messes me up at first. Due to these config
files, you could switch back to the previous config easily. I think there is no need
to include these files. When you try several configs, you will finally choose
one and use it for a long time. So I will make it simple. If you install
codervim. It will backup previous. When you uninstall codervim, it will use the
previous config.
