  Many programmer would notice that VIM could has the ability to highlight the keywords and identifiers when editing 
a script of some common programming language files. It is beautiful and could help us to have a better view of the code 
text. Of course, keywords and identifiers highlight are the basic function of IDE. So my question is does these two 
kinds of tools use the same way to highlight? If you want to build an IDE, what kind of knowledge is needed to highlight
keywords and identifiers?
