  There are several production configurations for VIM, such as spf,  amix. spd is very heavy, gorgeous. amix is much 
light-weighted. If offers two versions: Basic and Awesome . As a coder, I prefer vimrc much, 'cause I really do not need so many 
shortcuts, functions. I am afraid that there must be more bugs is a big system. Unfortunately, when I use vimrc, I found 
bugs. Perhaps they have it fixed right now.  codervim doest not provide multiple versions, 'cause I design it only for 
programmers' use. 
  I will compare these two best VIM configurations and introduce the components of VIM. So there is no need for the readers 
to read the source code of them. covervim is not meant to replace these configurations. We all have characteristics and 
purpose. codervim is designed for simple script language editing, like Python/Shell/PHP/Erlang/LISP, it does not support
strong-typed language like Java/C#/C++(IDE crushes VIM in doing this job).
