                               What is codervim

    codervim is just a simple vim config bundle. It is designed for programmers. At the early years of programmers' 
career, they would call themselves coder( or just we Chinese call it). I don't care whether the others call me coder or
not. I only care about what I am doing now and what I can do later. So this is
where the name codervim comes from. 
    And codervim is also a website. A series of articles that try to analysis the famous editor VIM to the new 
programmers. Although there are many powerful tools like Eclipse, IntelliJ, XCode and so on, I still think that 
everybody should use vim(or emacs) for small code. Of course, I do not support replacing IDE with VIM and as if VIM 
was something great, sth that could prove  you are a professional programmer. In fact, I think, if a Java programmer 
use VIM/Emacs to code, this action is defintely not smart. 
    So, why would I call it codervim, not programmervim. First, programmervim is too long. Second, I want to tell you 
that when you do not think yourself are a coder any more, you are upgraded, you are evolved.   I think, at that time, 
you would also do not care whether you are using VIM or Emacs, or IDE. I think, at that time, you would probably have
know the essence of these tools. You are not proud of using any of them. The days you explored the tools, eidtors, 
would be a precious memory of your life. 
  I think the most charming part of VIM, a simple editor who has a history more than twenty years, contains  advanced
techniques . Maybe you would think VIM is rather simple, but I have to say it is not that simple.

========================================>
  why should we use VIM(or Emacs)?
  Perhaps some VIM fans would ask why don't use VIM. I would not do that. I think   perhaps there is  something that 
I know and you don't know. I should talk about it here and let you make the choice. 
  We need to find the feeling of writing code.
  We need to understand what is happening when we write the code.
  We need to make things simple when we are doing simple things.
  
  Here are the ansers.
  1 Well, it is not easy to talk about feeling things. You can only get it by doing it. 
  
  2 Many new programmers like IDE much because it offers keywords, identifier high-lighting and key-assistant, 
especially Java programmers. Many people just like to use powerful tools to prove that themselve are powerful. What 
can I say about it? But do you really know how to high-light keyword, identifiers? Do you really know how a Java IDE 
could give suggestions when you need call an object's method and it could never be possible in VIM? Do these functions 
has anything to do with compiler techniques? Does regular research easy to implement for VIM? 
 
  3 Some people would argue that VIM is just a text editor. It is rather simple that it is not enough for a programmer.
But if you check VIM with "man vim", you will get the following line at first glance: 
  "vim - Vi IMproved, a programmers text editor"
 
 <======================================== 

  I hope when you have read all the articles here, you would like VIM.

 The last question: who we are?
 We are nobody. We are just normal programmers. Enjoy programming.
