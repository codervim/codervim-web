  There are several production configurations for VIM, such as spf,  amix. spf is very heavy, gorgeous. amix is much 
light-weighted. If offers two versions: Basic and Awesome . As a coder, I prefer vimrc much, 'cause I really do not need so many 
shortcuts, functions. I am afraid that there must be more bugs is a big system. Unfortunately, when I use vimrc, I found 
bugs. Perhaps they have it fixed right now.  codervim doest not provide multiple versions, 'cause I design it only for 
programmers' use. 
  I will compare these two best VIM configurations and introduce the components of VIM. So there is no need for the readers 
to read the source code of them. covervim is not meant to replace these configurations. We all have characteristics and 
purpose. codervim is designed for simple script language editing, like Python/Shell/PHP/Erlang/LISP, it does not support
strong-typed language like Java/C#/C++(IDE crushes VIM in doing this job). It
only off basic functions for source code editing. 


  
 Although all the functions you need for editing code are offered by 
already plug-ins, you would still hope to build a plug-in by the
hand of yourself. I think this would help us understand how the plug-in
and VIM cooperate and how it works. 
  As we could see, VIM script language is not so powerful as the config
language elisp of Emacs. So does it really matters? What is a better 
practice for designing a config language? 
   Let's first check the code of several example VIM plug-ins. Then we 
will give a simple conclusion to this topic.
